Scenario: Time is of the essence! There's a big meeting with the CEO in 1 hour to showcase the new interactive CR page. As usual, your boss only just told you about it and it needs to be completed right away!

Use the comp.png as a guide. Feel free to add any enhancements that add to the message, but be prepared to explain why you deviated from the marketing/design plan to the CEO... with the marketing/creative team in the same room.

For consistency during review, we'll go over the code solutions first from your repo on github.com and then see the layout. So check your code into github  at the end of the hour.
